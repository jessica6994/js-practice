    <h1>Array Problem set</h1>

    <h3>printReverse() :  write a function that takes an array as an argument and prints out the elements of the array in reverse order (don't actually reverse the array itself).</h3>
    <p>Hint: You need to use a loop.</p>

    <h3>isUniform()    : write a function which takes an array as an argument and returns true if all elements in the array are identical.</h3>
    <p>Hint: you'll want to use a loop. Also have a variable that keeps track of the first item in the index, and then compare that in the loop to the next item and so on.</p>

    <h3>sumArray()     :  write a function that accepts an array of numbers and returns the sum of all numbers in the array.</h3>
    <p>Hint: need to use a loop. Also need a variable called sum/answer/result to store the answer and add into it each time through the loop.</p>

    <h3>max()          :  write a function that accepts an array of numbers and returns the maximum number in the array.</h3>
    <p>Hint: need to use a loop. Need to use a variable that is going to store the maximum number, every time through the loop you'll need to update the variable if the current number in the loop is greater than the old maximum. </p>
